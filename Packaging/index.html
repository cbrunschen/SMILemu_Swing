<p>
It is with great pleasure that I can finally announce version 1.2 of SMILemu. This release 
has one main new feature: SMILemu now generates sound! (And the volume control indeed controls
the volume of the sound that SMILemu generates, as it should.) There is a new tab in the Options
window that allows you to configure whether sound should be enabled (the default) or not, and which
bit in which register should be used as the source for the sound.
</p>
<p>
The manual has been updated with a brief section on the sound capabilities of SMIL and SMILemu,
and to describe the changes in the Options window.
</p>
<p>
Please try it out, and feel free to comment!

<h3 align="center"><em>2006-01-19</em>: SMILemu 1.1</h3>
<p>
An improved version of SMILemu, version 1.1, is available immediately. This 
release contains bug fixes, improved unit tests, and includes a nicer
documentation browser, as well as a facility to extract the documentation from
SMILemu into a directory of your choice for offline reading or printing.
Additionally, SMILemu 1.1 can <a href="applet.html">run as an Applet</a> 
in your web browser, presuming you have a Java 5 runtime installed.
</p>
<p><font size="-1" color="#7f7f7f">Main Fixes:<ul>
<li>Logical Product instruction: wasn't working at all, now works as intended</li>
<li>Normalization instruction was off by one bit: Now shifts and counts correctly</li>
<li>Documentation had incorrect operand order for addition and logical product operations: documentation fixed</li>
</ul></font></p>

<p>
In 1956, SMIL &mdash; <b>S</b>iffer<b>m</b>askinen <b>i</b> <b>L</b>und, 'The  
Number Machine in Lund' &mdash; was deployed
at the University of Lund in Lund, Sweden. SMIL was built based on the 
blueprints for BESK, Bin&auml;r elektronisk Sekvens-Kalkylator, 'Binary Electronic 
Sequence Calculator', constructed in Stockholm in 1953 by 
Matematikmaskinn&auml;mnden, 
'The Mathematics Machine Committee'. Both BESK and SMIL were based on the design 
that had been produced by the Institute for Advanced Study, usually referred to
as the 'IAS Machine' design, which was used by several computer projects 
throughout the world.
</p><p>
To give today's computer users a feeling for how far the world of computers has
advanced in just 50 years, I present SMILemu, and emulator for SMIL, implemented
in portable Java 5, licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL) version 
2 or later. SMILemu attempts to honestly recreate the experience of using SMIL,
including SMIL's original execution speed. To make the emulator and the emulated
SMIL more accessible to a modern audience, SMILemu implements a number of 
optional extensions that make SMIL's memory and processor accessible in a way 
which was not possible in 1956, but gives a much easier view into the workings 
of SMIL.
